# Ticket Breakdown

We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**

Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".

You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

### Ticket 1: Create a `facility-agent` table for the respective NxN relationship to store the custom agent id

#### **Acceptance criteria**

- As an DBA or a developer, I want to be able to manage relationships between facilities and agents.
- As an developer or a tester, I want to test it in local and test environments;

#### **Time/effort estimates**

4h, small effort, complexity and risc.

#### **Implementation details**

- Create a table to represent the NxN relationship between `facility` and `agent`;
- The identificator has a max length of 30 characters;
- Make sure to correctly configure the foreign keys and the `UPDATE/DELETE` according to the current standards defined in [link to internal documentation];
- Update the database schema creator script by adding the DDL code related to the creation of the `facility-agant` table;
- Follow the patterns used in the previous database schema creator script defined in [link to internal documentation];
- Create the database backup and migration scripts;
- Follow the patterns used in the previous database backup and migration scripts defined in [link to internal documentation];

### Ticket 2: Migrate all the Agents ids in the generated reports to a default way of generating unique agent identificators

#### **Acceptance criteria**

- As a developer, I want to be able to use the autogenerated agent identificators even for the already registered relationships.
- As a developer or a tester, I want to test it in local and test environments;

#### **Time/effort estimates**

- 4h, small effort, complexity and risc.

#### **Implementation details**

- Create a script to get data from all the facilities and the agents related to their facility, generate the unique ids for each pair of facility/agent and insert these data into the recently created `facility-agent` table;
- Follow the patterns used in the previous data migration scripts defined in [link to internal documentation].
- Create the database backup and migration scripts;
- Follow the patterns used in the previous database backup and migration scripts defined in [link to internal documentation];

### Ticket 3: Update the service that registers the facility/agent relationship to generate a new row in `facility-agent` table with a custom id created by the final user or an autogenerated one

#### **Acceptance criteria**

- As an API consumer, I want to be able to register a custom identificator for each new pair of facility/agent or to have this id autogenerated.
- As an API consumer or a tester, I want to test it in local and test environments;

#### **Time/effort estimates**

- 4h, small effort, complexity and risc.

#### **Implementation details**

- Each new facility/agent relationship needs to be create on `facility-agent` table;
- Update integration tests to deal with the new way of relationship;
- Follow the patterns used in the previous integration tests defined in [link to internal documentation].

### Ticket 4: Create an endpoint that given a facility, an agent and an identificator checks if the identificator is valid and unique. Also, autogenerate a new identificator if the passed one is empty, invalid or non-unique

#### **Acceptance criteria**

- As an API consumer, I want to be able to check if a custom identificator for a pair of facility/agent is valid and unique;
- As an API consumer or a tester, I want to test it in local and test environments;

#### **Time/effort estimates**

- 4h, small effort, complexity and risc.

#### **Implementation details**

- The endpoint should check if the modified identificator is valid following the rule of: only alphanumeric and underscore characters;
- The endpoint should check if the identificator is unique by searching for the exact string in the `facility-agent` table;
- The endpoint should autogenerate a new identificator if the passed one is empty, invalid or non-unique;

### Ticket 5: Update the front-end page related to the creation/edition of the relationship between facilities and agents by adding an extra field for custom identificator

#### **Acceptance criteria**

- As a final user, I want to be able to choose between a suggested autogenerated identificator and to create a different one.
- As an developer or a tester, I want to test it in local and test environments;

#### **Time/effort estimates**

- 4h, small effort, complexity and risc.

#### **Implementation details**

- As the final user enters in the facility/agent relationship creator screen it should see an autogenerated identificator;
- The final user can modify the identificator and a request will be sent to check if it's an unique identificator;
- The page will check if the modified identificator is valid following the rule of: only alphanumeric and underscore characters;
- This check need to be done automatically in a space of 300ms after stopping typing (debounce);
- The form should be tested using tyhe patterns defined in [link to internal documentation].
